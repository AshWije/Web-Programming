# Stock Data Webpage

This folder contains an example of visually representing stock data on a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JS.

An XML file (following an XML schema) is created with a matching JSON file (via createXMLAndJSON.java).
This XML file is then displayed neatly in an HTML table. The details of the stock information are also shown
through XPath.
